\section{Classical Kicked Rotor}

In the classical picture, we can write the Hamiltonian of single kicked top as 

\begin{equation}
{H}=\frac{{J}^2}{2{I}} +\sum_{n} {V}\delta(t-nT)
\end{equation}

where ${J}$ is the angular momentum of the top, ${I}$ is the moment of inertia, and ${V}$ is the kicked potential.

If we try to construct a system having two kicked tops coupled to each other, the corresponding Hamiltonian of the system can be written as

\begin{equation}
H=\frac{{J_1}^2}{2{I_1}}+\frac{{J_2}^2}{2{I_2}}+\sum_{n} (V_1+V_2+V_{12})\delta(t-nT)
\end{equation}

where $V_{12}$ is an interaction potential tha couples the dynamics of the system.

\section{Quantum Kicked Rotor}
In the quantum, we replace the angular momentum $J$'s by $\overbrace{hfak}
